            Ember Lumen is fiery… and not just because she’s a Fire element. She’s tough, quick-witted, smart, and a bit hot-headed. But, as the only child of immigrant parents, Ember is keenly aware of how much they sacrificed to give her a better life. Because of that, she is dedicated to repaying them by being a perfect daughter. That is, until she meets Wade, a Water element whose different perspective on life prompts Ember to ask some burning questions about her place in the world.

            Wade Ripple is transparent… and not only because he’s a Water element. He’s also emotionally transparent an open book, observant, empathetic and bubbling with compassion. When he meets Ember an element of distinctly different temperature Wade can’t help but wonder about a future that may seem impossible on the surface. Can these two opposites form a bond that transcends their differences?

            Bernie Lumen is a Fire element with a big, crackling personality that burns with pride… about his homeland, about his daughter, Ember, and about the shop he runs in Element City. He and his wife Cinder left Fire Land to provide a better life for their only child, bringing with them just their dreams. And make a better life is exactly what they did. Their neighborhood shop has become a destination for Fire elements, and Bernie is patiently awaiting the day Ember is ready to take it over.
